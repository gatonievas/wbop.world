## About the Project

The **World Historical Balance of Payments (WBoP)** is a global database on international transactions from the 1800 to today. It harmonizes balance of payments statistics across time and countries, enabling long-run comparative analysis of trade, capital flows, and macroeconomic adjustment.

The project is led by [Gast√≥n Nievas](https://www.gastonnievas.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Thomas Piketty](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/){:target="_blank"}.

The database is accompanied by a working paper and is intended as a public good for researchers, policymakers, and historians.
