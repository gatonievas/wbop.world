## About me

I am an Economics PhD candidate at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} and [École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS)](https://www.ehess.fr/fr){:target="_blank"}. I am working under the supervision of [Thomas Piketty](http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/en/){:target="_blank"}, with [Gabriel Zucman](https://gabriel-zucman.eu/){:target="_blank"} in my thesis committee.

Before joining PSE I spent 2 years as a Research Fellow at the InterAmerican Development Bank and 1 year at the World Bank, both in Washington D.C. (U.S.). I'm originally from Bahía Blanca (Argentina), where I did my BA in Universidad Nacional del Sur. I also hold a MA from Universidad de San Andrés and a MSc (Analysis and Policy in Economics) from PSE. 

My research interests lie within International Political Economy and Geoconomics, with a particular focus on International Macroeconomics.
